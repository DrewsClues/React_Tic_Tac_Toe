# React_Tic_Tac_Toe

## Description: 
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that uses React, it was part of Week 16 of the MIT full stack developer program. 

## How to run: 
Simply download the files from this repository. Place them in the same file then drag and drop the index.html file into a browser. It may be necessary to run Babel in an HTTP server.

## Roadmap:
In the future I would like a feature that allows users to set their own colors. Additionally, I would like to add a best two out of three game mode.
